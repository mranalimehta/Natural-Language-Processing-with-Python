# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Python

****************In nlp1.py *****************
It is first example of getting started with nlp using spaCy. 
spaCy is first imported.
Then english dictionary is loaded and then the text we want to analyse is assigned to the variable.
We pass our text to spacy to parse it and return a parsed data containing text and the typr of text it is.
